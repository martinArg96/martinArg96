## About Me

Hi there! I'm Martin a passionate full-stack developer with a focus on backend development using Spring Boot. I love creating robust and scalable solutions that make a positive impact. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about software architecture, or contributing to open source projects.
